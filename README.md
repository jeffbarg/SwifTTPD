# Swift HTTP1.1 Server

This is a simple HTTP server written in Swift 2.1 (https://swift.org/)

## Sample Use

Build by running ```swift build``` then run the generated executable with an optional port and root directory.  These default to port 3000 and /var/www.

## Compatability

Though this is set up to have Linux compatability, I have only tested it on Mac OSX 10.11.

## Credit

These is a swift adaptation of a C program found at http://tinyhttpd.sourceforge.net/
